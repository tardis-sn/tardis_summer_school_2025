This exercise is designed to engage your understanding of TARDIS plasma physics and atomic data, rather than relying on automated suggestions. In VSCode, you can temporarily disable autocomplete in notebook cells by navigating to **Settings → Notebook: Suggest Enabled** and unchecking the box, or by creating a workspace with a `.vscode/settings.json` file containing `\"notebook.suggest.enabled\": false`.

This lets us, among other things, easily evolve the ejecta profile to any given time since the velocity of each shell will not change.
