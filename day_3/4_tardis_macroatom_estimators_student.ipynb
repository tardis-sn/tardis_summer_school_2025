This exercise is designed to engage your understanding of TARDIS Monte Carlo physics, spectrum generation, and plasma treatments, rather than relying on automated suggestions. In VSCode, you can temporarily disable autocomplete in notebook cells by navigating to **Settings â†’ Notebook: Suggest Enabled** and unchecking the box, or by creating a workspace with a `.vscode/settings.json` file containing `\"notebook.suggest.enabled\": false`. This will help you focus on understanding the physics behind each step."
