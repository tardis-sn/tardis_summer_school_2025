    "# Overview: Post-Processing Hydro Models - From Explosion to Spectra\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will learn how to post-process hydrodynamic simulation models to create synthetic spectra using TARDIS. The example used here are from a delayed detonation model for thermonuclear supernova, obtained from [Heidelberg Supernova Model Archive (HESMA, see reference within)](https://old-hesma.h-its.org/doku.php?id=data:models:ddt_2013_n100_overview).\n",
    "This model is pre-parsed into the TARDIS configuration format and contains the ejecta conditions at $t = 100.22 s$ after the start of the explosion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Physics Behind Time Series Modeling in TARDIS**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: During the photospheric phase, supernovae undergo homologous expansion where density $\\rho(t) = \\rho(t_0) (\\frac{t}{t_0})^{-3}$ while maintaining the same structure in velocity space. This allows us to use a single ejecta model to generate spectra at multiple epochs by adjusting:\n",
    "- Time since explosion ($t_{\\text{exp}}$)\n",
    "- Bolometric luminosity ($L$) at given time\n",
    "- Inner boundary velocity ($v_{\\text{inner}}$) at given time\n",

    "<strong> Note:</strong> \n",
    "For thermonuclear explosions, the time it takes from the start of explosion to homology is usually short (on the scale of tens of seconds). However, it is often longer for core collapse supernovae (on the scale of hours to days).\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If the hydro model output does not provide photospheric velocity, the challenge is determining the correct $v_{\\text{inner}}$ at each epoch, which should correspond to the photospheric location where optical depth $\\tau \\approx 2/3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In TARDIS, this position corresponds to the location where the dilution factor $W=0.5$, which represents that 50% of the energy escapes compares to a black body. \n",
