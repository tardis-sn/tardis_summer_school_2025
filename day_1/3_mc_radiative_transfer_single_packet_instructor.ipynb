    "\n",
    "The mathematics for this calculation comes from solving the intersection of a ray with spherical surfaces. The geometry depends on the direction of photon motion:\n",

    "## Distance to Line Interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand Doppler transformations, we can calculate how far an MC packet must travel before it reaches resonance with a spectral line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Physics\n",
    "\n",
    "An MC packet will interact with a line when its comoving frequency equals the line frequency. Since the comoving frequency changes as the MC packet moves through the expanding medium (due to changing velocity), we need to calculate the distance to resonance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distance Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation involves finding where along the packet's trajectory the Doppler-shifted frequency matches the line rest frequency. In the expanding ejecta, the velocity changes with radius according to homologous expansion ($v = r/t$), which means the Doppler shift changes continuously as the packet moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a packet with rest frequency $\\nu_{\\text{lab}}$ moving in direction $\\mu$ at radius $r$, the comoving frequency is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nu_{\\text{comoving}} = \\nu_{\\text{lab}} \\times (1 - \\mu\\beta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\beta = v/c = r/(ct)$ is the dimensionless velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the packet moves distance $d$ and reaches a new radius $r'$, the new comoving frequency becomes $\\nu_{\\text{lab}} \\times (1 - \\mu\\beta')$ where $\\beta' = r'/(ct)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance to line interaction is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_{\\text{line}} = \\frac{(\\nu_{\\text{comoving}} - \\nu_{\\text{line}})}{\\nu_{\\text{lab}}} \\times c \\times t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\nu_{\\text{comoving}}$ is the MC packet frequency in the comoving frame at current position\n",
    "- $\\nu_{\\text{line}}$ is the rest frequency of the spectral line\n",
    "- $\\nu_{\\text{lab}}$ is the MC packet frequency in the lab frame\n",
    "- $c$ is the speed of light\n",
    "- $t$ is the time since explosion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If $\\nu_{\\text{comoving}} > \\nu_{\\text{line}}$**: MC packet is blue-shifted relative to line, will reach resonance\n",
    "- **If $\\nu_{\\text{comoving}} \\leq \\nu_{\\text{line}}$**: MC packet cannot reach resonance (return very large distance)\n",
    "- **Distance depends on**: Current position, direction, MC packet frequency, and expansion time\n",
    "\n",
    "A more complete description is available in the [TARDIS documentation](https://tardis-sn.github.io/tardis/physics/montecarlo/propagation.html#propagation-in-a-spherical-domain).\n",
    "\n",
    "### $\\blacktriangleright$ Task 2: Implement Line Distance Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you'll implement the function that calculates how far a photon packet must travel before it reaches resonance with a spectral line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Physics:** The distance to line interaction is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_{\\text{line}} = \\frac{(\\nu_{\\text{packet,comoving}} - \\nu_{\\text{line,rest}})}{\\nu_{\\text{packet,rest}}} \\times c \\times t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\nu_{\\text{packet,comoving}} = \\nu_{\\text{packet,rest}} \\times (1 - \\mu\\beta)$ and $\\beta = v/c = r/(ct)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test your function** with several scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Blue packet**: Use a packet frequency much bluer than the line rest frequency (e.g., from ~6000-6300 Ã…). Remember that lab frequency is \"defined\"\" at the center. Thus they are redshifted at the inner boundary at radius `R_INNER`. A packet needs to be significantly bluer than the line frequency to still have enough \"blue-ness\" left to reach resonance as it travels outward through the expanding ejecta. (use the doppler-factor to help you).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Red packet**: Use a redder frequency than the line rest frequency - should return large distance since it can never reach resonance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Critical test**: Use the exact frequency that would red-shift to line rest frequency at the outer boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Physical Insight:** In expanding supernovae, packets are continuously red-shifted as they move outward. Only packets that start sufficiently blue-shifted (much bluer than the line frequency) can eventually reach resonance with the line somewhere in their outward journey. Packets that are only slightly bluer than the line frequency may have already been red-shifted past resonance by the time they reach the inner boundary.\n",

    "1. **Calculate distances** to both boundary and line interactions using our functions\n",

    "- **Scattering**: If $\\tau_{\\text{event}} < \\tau_{\\text{Sobolev}}$, packet scatters with new random direction\n",
    "- **Position update**: Use the move_packet function with spherical geometry\n",

    "# Key Lessons Learned: How TARDIS Really Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've now implemented the core physics behind TARDIS's Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulation. Let's summarize the key concepts and see how they connect to the full TARDIS implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Monte Carlo Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The single-packet simulation you built demonstrates the fundamental algorithm that TARDIS uses for **every energy Monte Carlo packet**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Distance Calculations**\n",
    "For each packet, TARDIS calculates multiple distances:\n",
    "- **Distance to boundaries** (inner/outer shell boundaries)\n",
    "- **Distance to electron scattering** interactions  \n",
    "- **Distance to line interactions** (for each spectral line in the simulation)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Optical Depth Sampling** \n",
    "At the start of each packet's journey, TARDIS draws a **random optical depth**:\n",
    "$$\\tau_{\\text{event}} = -\\ln(\\text{random})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This single random number determines when the packet will interact during its journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **The Decision Tree**\n",
    "TARDIS then follows this decision process:\n",
    "\n",
    "**If the boundary distance is shortest:**\n",
    "- Move packet to the boundary\n",
    "- **If inner boundary**: Packet is captured (simulation ends)\n",
    "- **If outer boundary**: Packet escapes (simulation ends)\n",
    "\n",
    "**If an interaction distance is shortest:**\n",
    "- **Do NOT move the packet yet!**\n",
    "- Instead, check if the interaction WOULD actually occur\n",
    "- Compare $\\tau_{\\text{event}}$ with the interaction's optical depth\n",
    "- **If interaction occurs**: Handle scattering and reset $\\tau_{\\text{event}}$\n",
    "- **If interaction doesn't occur**: Subtract the optical depth from $\\tau_{\\text{event}}$ and continue\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Cumulative Opacity Effects**\n",
    "This is the key insight: **Weak interactions add up!**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a packet \"flies through\" many weak lines or low-density regions without scattering, TARDIS:\n",
    "- Subtracts each line's optical depth from $\\tau_{\\text{event}}$\n",
    "- Subtracts electron scattering opacity from $\\tau_{\\text{event}}$\n",
    "- Eventually, $\\tau_{\\text{event}}$ becomes so small that even a very weak line interaction (with very small $\\tau_{\\text{Sobolev}}$) becomes larger than the remaining $\\tau_{\\text{event}}$, causing scattering to occur\n",
    "\n",
    "This correctly reproduces the physics: **many weak interactions have the same cumulative effect as one strong interaction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## From Simple to Complex\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you implemented today:**\n",
    "- Single shell, single line, simplified physics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Full TARDIS simulation:**\n",
    "- Multiple shells with different densities and compositions\n",
    "- Potentially millions of spectral lines\n",
    "- Both line and electron scattering\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But the **core algorithm is identical** to what you built! Every packet follows the same distance calculation â†’ optical depth sampling â†’ decision tree process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Big Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "You've learned the fundamental physics that makes TARDIS possible:\n",
    "- **Spherical geometry** for packet movement\n",
    "- **Doppler physics** in expanding media\n",
    "- **Frame transformations** for scattering\n",
    "- **Monte Carlo sampling** for interaction probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts scale directly to full supernova simulations with millions of packets and complex 3D ejecta structures (beyond CURRENT TARDIS capability).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Well done!** You now understand the heart of how Monte Carlo radiative transfer works in astrophysics. **Next** Let's make this our own small TARDIS"

    "You've successfully implemented the fundamental components of Monte Carlo radiative transfer from first principles. Here are the key computational and physics insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Geometric Framework**\n",
    "- **Spherical coordinates** with homologous expansion: $v = r/t$\n",
    "- **Ray-sphere intersections** for boundary distance calculations\n",

    "- **Distance competition**: Boundary vs. line interaction distances\n",
    "- **Isotropic scattering** with proper frame transformation sequences\n",

    "- Same core algorithm with millions of packets\n",
    "- Multiple shells, thousands of lines, electron scattering\n",
    "- Identical distance calculations and decision tree logic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight**: The fundamental MC algorithm you implemented scales directly to production simulations â€” TARDIS (or Sedona or ARTIS or SuperNu and others of course) uses the same physics at its core.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next**: Combine many packets to generate synthetic spectra and see P Cygni profiles emerge naturally from first principles!"
